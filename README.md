Hi! This repository contains my solutions for the MLA202 Reinforcement Learning take-home practical. I have completed all three problems and organized the code for clarity.

Files included:
- 03230235_practical_test.ipynb : My main notebook with all solutions and plots.
- 03230235_gridworld.py : GridWorld environment class used in Problem 1.
- 03230235_frozenlake_fix.py : Fixed Q-learning code for FrozenLake in Problem 3.
- 03230235_dqn_agent.py : DQN agent classes for Problem 2 (optional).

Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, torch, gymnasium

How to run:
1. Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Install the required libraries using:
   pip install numpy matplotlib torch gymnasium
3. Open '03230235_practical_test.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code Jupyter extension.
4. Run all the cells from top to bottom to see the results and plots.
5. Everything should run smoothly as I have tested it.

Thanks for checking my work!
